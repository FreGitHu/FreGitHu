# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm FreGitHu, just your average developer, I just **don't** like Git very much.

## What I'm Doing (not accurate)
Here's some things I'm probably doing.

- Might be making *cool* projects.
- Probably won't be collaborating to open source but, you never know!
- At least making not bad projects, maybe a bit bad.
- Ok, I dunno at this point.
